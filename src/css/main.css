/* this file gets tailwind classes into the app. the file is first processed
 * by postcss-loader, which generates the tailwind classes (see
 * postcss.config.js), but leaves the @tailwind directives here (meaning
 * importing the file will error). then css-loader resolves the '@' statements
 * in this file to actual CSS (but then outputs this as JS strings), and
 * finally, style-loader wraps the previous step in JS that injects the css
 * into the DOM.
